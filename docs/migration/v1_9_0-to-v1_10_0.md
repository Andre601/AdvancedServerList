# v1.9.0 to v1.10.0

v1.9.0 introduced a `motds` option to define multiple MOTDs to use.  
However, this option has been removed just one update later in v1.10.0, meaning any server list profile using the `motds` option will no longer work as expected.

## Migration

To migrate all you have to do is use the new `profiles` option and add separate List entries with a `motd` option.

## Example

Here is a before and after example to help visualize the change:

/// tab | Before
```yaml
priority: 0

motds:
  - |-
    Line 1
    Line 2
  - |-
    Line A
    Line B

favicon: '${player name}'

playerCount:
  hidePlayers: false
  players:
    - 'Line 1'
    - 'Line 2'
    - 'Line 3'
  text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
  extraPlayers:
    enabled: false
    amount: 0
```
///

/// tab | After
```yaml
priority: 0

profiles:
  # You can also use motd: ['Line 1', 'Line 2']
  - motd:
      - 'Line 1'
      - 'Line 2'
  # You can also use motd: ['Line A', 'Line B']
  - motd:
      - 'Line A'
      - 'Line B'

favicon: '${player name}'

playerCount:
  hidePlayers: false
  players:
    - 'Line 1'
    - 'Line 2'
    - 'Line 3'
  text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
  extraPlayers:
    enabled: false
    amount: 0
```
///

/// tab | Diff View
```diff
priority: 0

-motds:
