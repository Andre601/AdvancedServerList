# Migrate from v1.9.0 to v1.10.0

v1.9.0 introduced a `motds` option to define multiple MOTDs to use.  
However, this option has been removed just one update later in v1.10.0, meaning any server list profile using the `motds` option will no longer work as expected.

## Migration

To migrate all you have to do is use the new `profiles` option and add separate List entries with a `motd` option.

## Example

Here is a before and after example to help visualize the change:

=== "Before"
    ```yaml
    priority: 0

    motds:
      - |-
        Line 1
        Line 2
      - |-
        Line A
        Line B
    
    favicon: '${player name}'

    playerCount:
      hidePlayers: false
      players:
        - 'Line 1'
        - 'Line 2'
        - 'Line 3'
      text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
      extraPlayers:
        enabled: false
        amount: 0
    ```
=== "After"
    ```yaml
    priority: 0
    
    profiles:
      # You can also use motd: ['Line 1', 'Line 2']
      - motd:
          - 'Line 1'
          - 'Line 2'
      # You can also use motd: ['Line A', 'Line B']
      - motd:
          - 'Line A'
          - 'Line B'
    
    favicon: '${player name}'
    
    playerCount:
      hidePlayers: false
      players:
        - 'Line 1'
        - 'Line 2'
        - 'Line 3'
      text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
      extraPlayers:
        enabled: false
        amount: 0
    ```
=== "Diff view"
    ```diff
    priority: 0

    -motds:
    -  - |-
    -    Line 1
    -    Line 2
    -  - |-
    -    Line A
    -    Line B
    +profiles:
    +  # You can also use motd: ['Line 1', 'Line 2']
    +  - motd:
    +      - 'Line 1'
    +      - 'Line 2'
    +  # You can also use motd: ['Line A', 'Line B']
    +  - motd:
    +      - 'Line A'
    +      - 'Line B'
    
    favicon: '${player name}'
    
    playerCount:
      hidePlayers: false
      players:
        - 'Line 1'
        - 'Line 2'
        - 'Line 3'
      text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
      extraPlayers:
        enabled: false
        amount: 0
    ```
