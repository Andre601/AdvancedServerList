# v1.5.3 to v1.6.0

v1.6.0 has some structural changes to the server list profile that requires you to do some updates on your files.

## Migration

The migration should be fairly simple. [An example](#example) is available to look at.

- `playerCount` is no longer a String but has been turned into a section containing the `hidePlayers` option and the following renamed options:
    - `players` -\> `hover`
    - `playerCount` -\> `text`
- `xMore` has been removed. There is now a new section called `extraPlayers` in the `playerCount` section as a replacement.  
  It contains the following options:
    - `enabled` - to enable/disable the feature.
    - `amount` - This is the former `xMore` option. Difference is, that it also allows negative numbers.

## Example

Here is a before and after example to help visualize the change:

/// tab | Before
```yaml
priority: 0

motd:
  - 'Line 1'
  - 'Line 2'

favicon: '${player name}'

hidePlayers: false

players:
  - 'Line 1'
  - 'Line 2'
  - 'Line 3'

playerCount: '<grey>Hover Me!'

xMore: 1
```
///

/// tab | After
```yaml
priority: 0

motd:
  - 'Line 1'
  - 'Line 2'

favicon: '${player name}'

playerCount:
  hidePlayers: false
  
  hover:
    - 'Line 1'
    - 'Line 2'
    - 'Line 3'
  
  text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
  
  extraPlayers:
    enabled: true
    amount: 1
```
///

/// tab | Diff View
```diff
priority: 0

motd:
  - 'Line 1'
  - 'Line 2'

favicon: '${player name}'

-hidePlayers: false
