# v1.5.3 to v1.6.0

v1.6.0 has some structural changes to the server list profile that requires you to do some updates on your files.

## Migration

The migration should be fairly simple. [An example](#example) is available to look at.

- `playerCount` is no longer a String but has been turned into a section containing the `hidePlayers` option and the following renamed options:
    - `players` -\> `hover`
    - `playerCount` -\> `text`
- `xMore` has been removed. There is now a new section called `extraPlayers` in the `playerCount` section as a replacement.  
  It contains the following options:
    - `enabled` - to enable/disable the feature.
    - `amount` - This is the former `xMore` option. Difference is, that it also allows negative numbers.

## Example

Here is a before and after example to help visualize the change:

=== "Before"
    ```yaml
    priority: 0
    
    motd:
      - 'Line 1'
      - 'Line 2'
    
    favicon: '${player name}'
    
    hidePlayers: false
    
    players:
      - 'Line 1'
      - 'Line 2'
      - 'Line 3'
    
    playerCount: '<grey>Hover Me!'
    
    xMore: 1
    ```
=== "After"
    ```yaml
    priority: 0
    
    motd:
      - 'Line 1'
      - 'Line 2'
    
    favicon: '${player name}'
    
    playerCount:
      hidePlayers: false
      
      hover:
        - 'Line 1'
        - 'Line 2'
        - 'Line 3'
      
      text: '<grey>Hover Me!'
      
      extraPlayers:
        enabled: true
        amount: 1
    ```
=== "Diff view"
    ```diff
    priority: 0
    
    motd:
      - 'Line 1'
      - 'Line 2'
    
    favicon: '${player name}'
    
    -hidePlayers: false
    -
    -players:

    -
    -playerCount: '<grey>Hover Me!'
    -
    -xMore: 1
    +playerCount:
    +  hidePlayers: false
    +  
    +  hover:
    +    - 'Line 1'
