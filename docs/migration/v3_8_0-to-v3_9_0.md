# v3.8.0 to v3.9.0

v3.9.0 brings a small change to the `~=` operand by changing it to `=~` for sake of consistent pattern design. Additionally, was `~` added as a single-character equivalent to `=`.

## Migration

To migrate, switch any appearances of `~=` with `=~` or `~`.

## Example

Here is a before and after example to help visualize the change:

/// tab | Before
```yaml
priority: 0

condition: '${player name} ~= "Someone"'

motd:
  - 'Welcome ${player name}!'
```
///

/// tab | After
```yaml
priority: 0

condition: '${player name} =~ "Someone"'

motd:
  - 'Welcome ${player name}!'
```
///

/// tab | Diff View
```diff
priority: 0

-condition: '${player name} ~= "Someone"'
+condition: '${player name} =~ "Someone"'

motd:
  - 'Welcome ${player name}!'
```
///
