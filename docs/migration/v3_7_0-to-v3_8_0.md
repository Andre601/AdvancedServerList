# v3.7.0 to v3.8.0

v3.8.0 brought a small yet important change to the condition system, which is the change of the "contains" operand from `<-` to `<_` to avoid possible issues with numbers.

## Migration

To migrate, switch any appearances of `<-` with `<_`

## Example

Here is a before and after example to help visualize the change:

/// tab | Before
```yaml
priority: 0

condition: '${server host} <- "survival"'

motd:
  - 'Welcome ${player name}!'
```
///

/// tab | After
```yaml
priority: 0

condition: '${server host} <_ "survival"'

motd:
  - 'Welcome ${player name}!'
```
///

/// tab | Diff View
```diff
priority: 0

-condition: '${server host} <- "survival"'
+condition: '${server host} <_ "survival"'

motd:
  - 'Welcome ${player name}!'
```
///
