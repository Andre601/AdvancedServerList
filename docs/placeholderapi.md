# PlaceholderAPI Placeholders

The Spigot and Paper version of AdvancedServerList provide their own set of placeholders to use through [PlaceholderAPI].

## Placeholders

!!! note
    AdvancedServerList will try to find a matching Profile for the player similar to when they ping the server when using any of the below placeholders.
