# Should the Caching of players be disabled?
#
# When set to true will AdvancedServerList not load any players from the cache.data file (if present) nor save any to it.
# Placeholders that rely on the player being cached (such as ${player isWhitelisted}) will not work while this option is enabled.

#
# Should AdvancedServerList check for new versions?
#
# When set to true will AdvancedServerList connect to modrinth.com to check for any new versions for the platform it is used
# on. This check only happens when the plugin enables.
