# Should the Caching of players be disabled?
#
# When set to true will AdvancedServerList not load any players from the cache.data file (if present) nor save any to it.
# Placeholders that rely on the player being cached (such as ${player name}) will not work while this option is enabled.
#
# Defaults to false when not present.

disableCache: false

#
# Should AdvancedServerList check for new versions?
#
# When set to true will AdvancedServerList check for a new version on modrinth.com every 12 hours and inform you in the
# console about whether it found any new update or not.
#
# Defaults to false when not present.
#
checkUpdates: true

#
# Should debug mode be enabled?
#
# When set to true will AdvancedServerList print additional messages to the console prefixed with "[DEBUG]".
# It is recommended to only enable this when having problems or when being told to by the plugin dev, as it could
# otherwise cause significant spam in your console.
#
# Defaults to false when not present.
