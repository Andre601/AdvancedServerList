# Option that allows you to define multiple profiles to use.
# Each entry supports the same options as the server list profile does. Whenever an option is not present, or set to
# an empty value (If supported) would the option in the file be used (if present).
# This allows you to f.e. randomize the MOTD while keeping other options the same, without copy-pasting the same options.
#
# A profile will be selected randomly.
#
# Remove this option or set it to profiles: [] to use the global options of this file.
